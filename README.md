# using graph interactive the show the effect free and total - sulfur dioxide in the quality

px.scatter(df, x="free sulfur dioxide", y="total sulfur dioxide",animation_frame="quality")

# Analysis result
We have 5 types of quality in DataSet - 3 to 8Â¶
The Best quality 8
The less quality 3 ### The elements highest effect on the quality of wine:
1 - Alcohol
2 - Free sulfur dioxide
3 - Total sulfur dioxide
